                        <p>Gemini, formerly known as Bard, is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Google. Based on the large language model (LLM) of the same name and developed as a direct response to the meteoric rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, it was launched in a limited capacity in March 2023 to lukewarm responses before expanding to other countries in May.

                            The chatbot was previously based on Pathways Language Model(PaLM), and initially the Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA) family of large language models. LaMDA was developed and announced in 2021, but was not released to the public out of an abundance of caution. OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 and its subsequent popularity caught Google executives off-guard and sent them into a panic, prompting a sweeping response in the ensuing months. After mobilizing its workforce, the company launched Bard in February 2023; it took center stage during the 2023 Google I/O keynote in May, and was upgraded to the Gemini LLM in December. Bard and Duet AI were unified under the Gemini brand in February 2024.
                            
                            Gemini Pro in Bard
                            Before bringing it to the public, we ran Gemini Pro through a number of industry-standard benchmarks. In six out of eight benchmarks, Gemini Pro outperformed GPT-3.5, including in MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding), one of the key leading standards for measuring large AI models, and GSM8K, which measures grade school math reasoning.
                            
                            On top of that, we’ve specifically tuned Gemini Pro in Bard to be far more capable at things like understanding, summarizing, reasoning, coding and planning. And we’re seeing great results: In blind evaluations with our third-party raters, Bard is now the most preferred free chatbot compared to leading alternatives.
                            
                            We also teamed up with YouTuber and educator Mark Rober to put Bard with Gemini Pro to the ultimate test: crafting the most accurate paper airplane. Watch how Bard helped take the creative process to new heights.
                            
                            Gemini Ultra is our largest and most capable model, designed for highly complex tasks and built to quickly understand and act on different types of information — including text, images, audio, video and code.
